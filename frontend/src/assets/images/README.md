# Placeholder Images

This directory contains placeholder images for the app blocker backgrounds. In a production app, you would replace these with actual high-quality nature images.

The following placeholder images should be added to this directory:

1. `placeholder-forest.png` - A forest scene
2. `placeholder-ocean.png` - An ocean scene
3. `placeholder-mountains.png` - A mountain landscape
4. `placeholder-sunset.png` - A sunset scene
5. `placeholder-stars.png` - A night sky with stars

These images should be approximately 1080x1920 pixels (portrait orientation) to fit well on most mobile screens.

## Image Credits

When using images in a production app, make sure to:

1. Use royalty-free images or purchase appropriate licenses
2. Credit photographers when required
3. Optimize images for mobile devices to reduce app size
